  <div id="statement">
  When I first heard this quoate it immediately resonated with me and I knew I was exactly where I was meant to be at that moment in life, to hear that quote, and reaffirm some of my most recent, and wonderous, visions, ideations and beliefs I had been experiencing! <br>
  <br>

I am spiritual, I believe in a higher power, whom I choose to address as God, but it is my own interpretation, my own personal ideas, and my own personal belief system that I choode to have faith in. I do not need to explain every little detail of my beliefs, because they may be extremely differant than someone elses, and that is perfectly okay too! I think it is extremely important to have faith in something bigger than yourself, but once again it is a personl ideology and perception of whatever or whomeever each individual chooses to believe in, and all that matters is that it provides hope, faith and happiness!
<br>
<br>

My journey has been long and steady and filled with lot's of trials and tibulations, and sometimes I never knew what it was I was suppose to learn from those experiences, until later in life. When I can finally say,"Awww, now that makes sense!" Those are great moments! My personal experience is that everything happens for a reason, whether we realise it at that exact moment in time, or later in life during those Aha moments!
<br>
<br>

I founded New Found Oasis in hopes of encouraging like minded indidvidals to share experience, insights and support to one another while exploring their own personal paths to their own sacred oasis within!

<h2>Discover The Oasis Within</h2>
<p> This is a blog for those on a personal journey to self discovery. Whether you are consciously walking this path, or intuitivley found yourself here, chances are there is something meant for you to read at this point in time.<br>
  All we ask is that you keep an open mind. The posts are meant for you to take what you need and leave behind what does not resonate with you at this time.<br>
   No two beings have the same experience, and therefore they will perceive and interpret things differently. There is no one fits all answer to the questions you may be asking. If you get any answers, any sense of direction or even just a glimpse of hope, than we have succeeded at what we have set out to do.</p>
